jzForm is a system for seperating content from presentation when building
forms.  Its goal it is to allow one program or one part of a program to
declare what kind of data it need back, another to format that request for
display to the user, and a third to provide the answer. It provides
functionality for verifying that data returned matched the request.  The hope
is that this program will take care of a lot of the back and forth between
programs and their ultimate users.
